Welcome to my application. This application has only two options for now in web browser:
1. You can write your name and application will welcome you
2. You can choose langague

There are a few step to run it:

1. Run App.class
2. Write localhost:8080/api
3. To send your name you have to write for example: localhost:8080/api?name=Agnieszka
4. To read this message in polish you have to add: localhost:8080/api?name=Agnieszka&lang=2
